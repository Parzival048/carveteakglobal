## 📝 About Sagwan Wood

**Sagwan** is the Hindi/Indian name for **Teak wood** (Tectona grandis). Both terms refer to the same premium hardwood known for:

- Exceptional durability and strength
- Natural resistance to water, insects, and rot
- Beautiful golden-brown color that ages gracefully
- High oil content that makes it weather-resistant
- Traditional use in luxury furniture and boat building

**Why the change?**
Using "Sagwan" instead of "Sheesham" aligns the product descriptions with the actual wood type being used. Sheesham (Indian Rosewood) and Sagwan (Teak) are different wood species with distinct characteristics.
